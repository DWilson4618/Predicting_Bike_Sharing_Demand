## Predicitng_Bike_Sharing_Demand
#
# PROJECT OVERVIEW #
#
## This project was part of the:
# IBM Data Science wiht R Professional Certificate w/ Coursera Capstone. 
#
## This GitHub Repository is designed to showcase the steps that were taken to accomplish the goal of predicitng brike sharing demand for a few major cities based on estimated live weather conditions. 
#
## Each section of this repository will consist of the code used for each step along the journey of going from raw data, to a predictive model with a dashboard of past attempts, followed up with a data analysis report show casing the results and derived meaning. 
#
#This Repository is to act as a hub for the code used, provided in a clean format for easy duplication, deeper analysis, future projects, or just a simple review.
# For each section of this Repository, the files that were used were provided by coursera and IBM in the beginning of each section. You can either use the same files or use the files you will create in each section.
