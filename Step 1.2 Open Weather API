# For this step we will be collecting real-time current and forecasted weather data for 
# cities using the OpenWeather API. 
# For this step you will need to create an account with Open Weather and generate an 
# Api key to use to extract the weather data. Below i have provided the code and removed
# the API key to prevent use of my personal account

# Import the proper libraries 
require("httr")
library(httr)

# URL for Current Weather API
current_weather_url <- 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'

# need to be replaced by your real API key
your_api_key <- #"YOUR API KEY"#
# Input `q` is the city name
# Input `appid` is your API KEY, 
# Input `units` are preferred units such as Metric or Imperial
current_query <- list(q = "Seoul", appid = your_api_key, units="metric")
