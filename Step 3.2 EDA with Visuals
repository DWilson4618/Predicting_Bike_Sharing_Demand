# In this section we will perform some visualizations on our data sets to drive deeper
# understandings of the relationships between our predictor and dependent variables

# First we load the dataset and check its class
seoul_bike_sharing <- "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-RP0321EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/datasets/seoul_bike_sharing.csv"  
seoul_bike_sharing_df <- read.csv(seoul_bike_sharing)
sapply(seoul_bike_sharing_df, class)

# Next we recast the date, using the format of the dataset and check its class
seoul_bike_sharing_df$DATE <- as.Date(seoul_bike_sharing_df$DATE, "%Y/%m/%d")
sapply(seoul_bike_sharing_df, class)

# Next we cast the 'HOUR' column as categorical and check its class
seoul_bike_sharing_df$HOUR <- as.factor(seoul_bike_sharing_df$HOUR)
sapply(seoul_bike_sharing_df, class)

# Check the structure of the dataframe
str(seoul_bike_sharing_df)

# Finally, ensure there are no missing values
sum(is.na(seoul_bike_sharing_df))

# Now we can look at some high level stats of the dataset
summary(seoul_bike_sharing_df)

# How many Holidays are there
sumary(seoul_bike_sharing_df$HOLIDAY)

# what is the percentage of records that fall on a holiday
408/8057

# How many records should be expect to have in our data set considering there is a full year of data
str(seoul_bike_sharing_df$DATE)

# Based on the 'FUNCTIONING_DAY' how many records must there be? 
summary(seoul_bike_sharing_df$FUNCTIONING_DAY)

# Now load the dplyr package, group the data by 'SEASONS' and use the summarize function to 
# calculate the seasonal total rainfall and snowfall
avg_rain_snow <- seoul_bike_sharing_df %>%
group_by(SEASONS) %>%
summarize(mean_snow = mean(SNOWFALL,na.rm=TRUE),
          mean_rain = mean(RAINFALL,na.rm=TRUE))
avg_rain_snow

# Now lets visualize our data 
#
# First start with importing the ggplot2 package
